## 485_Game_Engine

This is the class project of USC ITP485.

I implemented a custom game engine with common functions and systems, such as lighting, collision detection, animation system, job system, profiling system, and post effect using C++ and DirectX 11

### First Video

This video shows player movement, character animation, basic Blinn-phong shading, bloom post-effect shader, normal mapping shader, and  collision detection

### Second Video

This video shows the CPU-based particle system implemented with compute shader.

## 420_OpenGL_Projects
These are class projects from USC CSCI-420 Computer Graphics

### Roller Coaster Project
In this project, I experimented with OpenGL version 3.3 to create a physically realistic roller coaster.

**implemented features**

1. Railways are created with Catmull-Rom splines

2. Camera. You can use WASD to move, use mouse to rotate, and mid-button to zoom in/out. Camera can also move along the railway

3. T-shaped rail cross-sections that are auto-generated by the program. 

4. Double rail and railway sleepers between them

5. Implemented sky and ground using cubemap.

6. Environment mapping for railways. If you look closer, you can see the railways are reflecting the environment.

7. Lighting! I added a directional light in the scene, and railway sleepers are rendered with Blinn-Phong model. If you move and rotate the camera around, you can see the specular.

8. Physically realistic movement.

### Ray Tracing Project

In this project, I implemented a CPU-based ray tracer. 

**Implemented features**

1. Bounding Volume Hierarchy for acceleration

2. Multisample Anti-Aliasing to generate high-quality images

3. multithreading to accelerate recursive reflection.
